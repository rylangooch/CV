## Rylan Gooch


The primary goal of my academic career was to develop a comprehensive world view. This process led me to two conclusions: 0. I love being at the intersection between the sciences and the arts. 1. Software has become the most effective means by which to effect positive change in the world. This is why coding ticks so many boxes for me; problem solving, abstract reasoning and the potential to have an impact to name a few. I've been spending the last 3 months learning the importance of writing code that is test-driven, modular and clean. I'm looking to build on these foundations in an ambitious team with a shared vision.



## Skills

#### Analytical

My brain only knows how to approach problems with systematic and logical reasoning. It’s this mindset that veered me towards mathematics, philosophy and economics in academia, and it’s one of the reasons why coding a such a box-ticker for me. During the final project at Makers Academy my teammates acknowledged that I was frequently able to conceptualise and articulate problems in a way that eased decision making.

#### Communication

Curiosity

Teamwork

<!-- Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)

- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.

#### Attention to Detail

As a Financial Planning Administrator, it was my responsibility to accurately provide the data that enabled our consultants to give sound advice. A misplaced ‘0’ was the difference between a jolly client and a fired consultant. My eye for detail allows me to view situations from multiple perspectives and quickly get to the core of the problem.
